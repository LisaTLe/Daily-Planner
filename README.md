# Daily-Planner

This web application is an electronic planner for day-to-day use. Users are able to schedule out their work day, and the planner will be able to indicate if the event has passed, is occurring, or is coming up. User's events will also be saved in the local storage until deleted, and anything saved will be displayed until deleted.
